# ViT Implementation using JAX and Flax
---

In this repository, a working implementation of the Vision transformer using JAX framework is used. Additionally, the JAX wrapper used for building the neural nets is Flax.

JAX is a high performance library similar to NumPy developed by Google optimized for GPU/TPU workloads.
